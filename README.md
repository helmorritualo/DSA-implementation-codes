This Website is a school project for learning data structures and algorithms. It is a web application that allows users to visualize and understand data structures and algorithms with multiple programming language support. The website has a variety of features, including algorithm examples, sorting algorithms, data structures, interactive visualizer, technical features, and technologies used. The website is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Font Awesome Icons, Prism.js for syntax highlighting, and Google Fonts (Inter). The website is also responsive and accessible on all devices.
